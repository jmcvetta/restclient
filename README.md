# restclient - DEPRECATED

Package `restclient` is a deprecated [Go](http://golang.org) client library for
interacting with [RESTful
APIs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#RESTful_web_APIs).
It has been replaced by [`napping`](https://github.com/jmcvetta/napping).  All
bugfixes and new development will occur in `napping`, but `restclient` will
remain available for some time.
